# webnn

Browser based Deep Neural Network training and inference powered by weblas.

Inference is currently implemented for the following layer types:

* Dense (fully connected/inner product)
* Convolution
* Pooling (max)
* ReLU

Support for more layers is planned, including:
* Pooling (avg)
* Normalization (local and batch)

Support for training (via backpropagation) is also planned.
